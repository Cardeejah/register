            These categories of Nanny will help you with manual chores at home, like cleaning, cooking or helping with your pile of laundry.
          They come in handy when you don't want to have a separate maid for cleaning and baby care. They also take care of your babies, 
        professionally and they are excellent home makers.</p>

          <h2>Creche Nanny</h2>
          <p class="lead">As a school owner, it may be difficult to get a smart, learned and dedicated nanny to look over your creche babies.
            We understand this, that is why we have Nannies specifically for schools. These nannies are well trained for school activities and the 
            best part is, you get to work with them on a contract basis. This eradicates the need to hire a permanent staff which could be costly.
            Our creche nannies are knowledgeable and equipped with the latest technological advancements, which makes it easier to play with children
            while utilizing the gadgets that you may provide. They will help look after your creche kids in the most healthy, educative and fun way 
            possible!.</p>
